## Other branches

Please see also the seperated branches of this project, at the time these are:
* [nwabap](https://github.com/pulseshift/openui5-gulp-starter-kit/tree/nwabap) is the OpenUI5 Starter Kit branch which allows a developer to upload SAPUI5/OpenUI5 sources into a SAP NetWeaver ABAP system as part of the Gulp task chain

### Features

| Feature                                | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❤ ES6/ES7 via Babel 6.0 | Compile [ES6/ES7](https://babeljs.io) into ES5 (supported by most browsers) with ease, bringing support for next generation JavaScript, today.                          |
| Less support                           | Compile [Less](http://lesscss.org) into CSS with ease, bringing support for variables, mixins and more.                                                                                                    |
| Consistent code formatting               | [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is an awesome opinionated code formatter used in many well known projects like Webpack, Babel or React. In this starter kit prettier re-formats your files that are marked as "staged" via git add before you commit. We recommend to [add also prettier as integration to your Editor](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) during development.                                                                                               |
| Built-in HTTP Server                   | An extendable [built-in server](https://www.browsersync.io) for previewing your site locally while you develop and iterate and the option to add API endpoints via a proxy to get around Access-Control-Allow-Origin (CORS) errors.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Live Browser Reloading                 | Reload the browser in real-time anytime an edit is made without the need for an extension. (Run `yarn start` and edit your files)                                                                                                                           |
| Cross-device Synchronization           | Synchronize clicks, scrolls, forms and live-reload across multiple devices as you edit your project. Powered by [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io). (Run `yarn start` and open up the IP provided on other devices on your network)                       |
| Production ready builds                     | Pre-configured build pipeline to create optimized assets, UI5 pre-loads etc. just as you would expect from a state of the art build process. All kind of UI5 asets are supported: App Components, Custom Themes, Control Libraries and non-UI5 assets roots. The structure of your project can be configured in your `package.json` in section `ui5`. _A detailed documentation of all options will follow soon._                                                                                                                                               |
| ⚡️ Reliable UI5 Cache-Buster                     | Ensure your users are always enjoying the latest version of your app. OpenUI5 provides only [solutions proprietary for SAP Gateway and SAP Cloud Platform](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/91f080966f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html). In this project, we added a more reliable mechanism that is open source and available for any environment. But much more important, with our Gulp build script, it works right out of the box.                                                                                                                                              |
| A Hackable UI5 Build Process                     | Define in your `package.json` the source of your OpenUI5 library. Supported options are online CDN link, download URL of a prebuild library or a GitHub release link of OpenUI5. In all cases, the build process will handle the download, unzip and OpenUI5 build task by its own. Lean back and wait relaxed.                                                                                                                                            |
| Pre-configured linter (ESLint)                     | [ESLint](https://eslint.org) is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript. It is pre-configured to work reliable and hand in hand with babel and prettier.                                                                                                                                           |

<!-- | Code Linting               | JavaScript code linting is done using [ESLint](http://eslint.org) - a pluggable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Run `yarn test` to lint your repository.                                                                         | -->

## Distribution

Start build:
_Will create a `dist` directory in your project root._
```
yarn build
```

Afterwards, the production app build can be tested by run `yarn start:dist`. The app should open in your browser automatically, otherwise open: `http://localhost:3000`

Info: To get a more detailed logging, just use `yarn build:verbose` instead.

### Contributing & Troubleshooting

Contributions, questions and comments are all welcome and encouraged.

### Outlook

Here is a brief overview on what we are working right know and what will follow, soon. We are interested to hear your opinion on what should follow next.

Current idea backlog (unordered):
- Add a further project based on Webpack
- Add Facebooks flow type system with help of vagrant to support Windows machines, too
- Unit test and browser test framework
- Build process for custom UI5 control libraries [available as BETA]
- Build process for custom UI5 themes [available as BETA]
- Documentation generation via JSDoc
- Optimized OpenUI5 library modules (containing only these controls you used)
- I18N helper integration
